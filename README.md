## 📚 What I Learned
This project demonstrates React state management, API integration, component layout structuring, and local storage handling in a real-world dashboard interface.

## ⚙️ Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Handling asynchronous API calls without blocking UI  
**Solution:** Used `useEffect` with proper async function handling and loading states

**Challenge:** Persisting user favourites between sessions  
**Solution:** Integrated `localStorage` with state synchronisation

**Challenge:** Managing multiple views within a single-page app  
**Solution:** Implemented view-based conditional rendering


## 🧠 Technical Highlights

- Implemented dynamic search with external API integration (iTunes API)
- Managed application state using React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`)
- Implemented persistent user data using `localStorage`
- Designed multi-view dashboard layout with component-based structure
- Built responsive UI using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Handled asynchronous operations and loading states
- Deployed production build using Netlify CI/CD pipeline
